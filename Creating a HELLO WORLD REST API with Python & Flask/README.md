 - In this lab, you will learn how to create a Products's list using Flask server. Your application should allow you to add a product, retrieve the products, retrieve a specific product with its id, update a specific product with its id, and delete a product with its id. All these operations will be achieved through the REST API endpoints in your Flask server.

- You will create an application with API endpoints to perform Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete operations on the above data using a Flask server.

You will use cURL and Swagger to test the implemented endpoints.
