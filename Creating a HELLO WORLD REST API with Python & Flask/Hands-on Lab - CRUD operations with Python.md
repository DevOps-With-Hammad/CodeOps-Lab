# Hands-on Lab - CRUD operations with Python

- In this lab, you will learn how to create a Products's list using a Flask server. Your application should allow you to add a product, retrieve the products, retrieve a specific product with its id, update a specific product with its id, and delete a product with its id. All these operations will be achieved through the REST API endpoints in your Flask server.

You will create an application with API endpoints to perform Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete operations on the above data using a Flask server.

You will use cURL and POSTMAN to test the implemented endpoints.



# Objectives:
 After completing this lab you will be able to:

 - Create API endpoints to perform Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete operations on transient data with a Flask server.
 - Create REST API endpoints, and use POSTMAN to test your REzST APIs.
